### Project Description
Our project is a messaging app that surprises users with random messages instead of delivering the intended text and the message that is send by the user doesn't reach the receiver.It is a fun and experimental app . 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Today's messaging apps are too predictable living no room for fun misunderstanding.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our app sends unpredictable messages back to the receiver.
